In this assignment I have tried to update the Assignment 4.

During my review for assignment 4 I was told that the template method pattern is not applied properly so it is not a Template Method and more of a strategy pattern.
So I have updated the code to template pattern by adding common method/logic.

In this assignment I have tried to work on the points I got missed in my assignment 4.

So following are the things I have updated in this assignment:
1. Strategy to Template pattern
2. Added more test cases for all kinds of possible sudoku puzzles of different sizes.
3. updated the diagrams
4. The 16x16 and 25x25 puzzles are solving, but are taking a huge amount of time in solving as my different algorithm are based on guess method.
